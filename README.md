# Why

I'm going to adopt PWA to my web applications and those web apps are heavily using Axios with the default XMLHTTPRequest adapter. Hence, I have to switch to Fetch adapter; However, Axios doesn't have an adapter for fetch API for now. So I write one to use while waiting for an offical one from Axios.

# Installation and Usage

This is just another fork but at least it works with 1.4 axios. I dont have time to publish it. YMMV
